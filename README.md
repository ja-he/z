# `z`

A simple, git-centric, and qualitatively dubious note management system for my personal use.

## What is this?

Hopefully a reliable and well-written recreation of what so far has been a very hacky and reliably error-prone shell script.

It's supposed to be the system that helps me approach my notes with minimal mental overhead:

- Simple CLI for common operations (new text note, search by filename, sync, ...)
- Opinionated wherever an opinion makes things easier at note-taking-time
- Integration with my editor
- Built around my preferred tools/formats

## Who is this for?

Just me.
I can't stop you from using it, but I don't think you'll like it too much because I don't intend in putting any effort into making it likeable.
(I have to like it either way due to [sunk cost fallacy])
